# Preamble

The goal of this page is to show what X-band satellites are receivable in this band in a presentable way, 'demystifying' the broadcasts. I will also include information about every individual transmission that is required to receive it.

Every satellite will have full resolution sample imagery provided from my [archive](https://sat-archive.metislair.com). **This is NOT an X-band reception guide**, the scope of such a guide is way out of my depth at the moment. I have personally NOT received these and likely will not do so for a while given the high initial cost.


# Introduction

X-band reception is a very advanced endeavor, given the severe lack of documentation online, high cost of entry, as well as the dedication required - You **will** fall flat on your face a lot! I might describe this process some day when I get enough disposable income to try it out myself, but for the time being, I will try to write out what I know fairly well already - **the satellites' broadcasts**.

The minimum dish size is inapplicable to this band because of the significant variance between setups, the low margins introduced with X can make two nearly identical setups perform worlds apart because of minimal differences. A relative strength is included to get an idea of how strong a signal is, consider "Strong" something you should be able to get with an 80 cm dish. It is done by feel from personal experience, don't consider it definitive.

## Formatting

Each satellite will start with a compressed preview image to roughly show what you can get, followed by a brief description of the series in question in the `Description` heading.

Following the description is the `Signal table(s)` heading which contains information about the transmission(s) in question in the following format:

<u>Name of transmission</u> - Potential notes

| Satellite                 | Frequency | Symbol rate | Polarization | FEC                    | Relative strength                                           | Beamed                                               | Location                                                                |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transmitting satellite(s) | S/E       | S/E         | S/E          | Whether signal has FEC | Strength relative to something receivable with a small dish | Whether signal is transmitted at a specific location | If beamed, location of beam. Otherwise, area where the signal is active |

> S/E = Self explanatory

What follows after is some sample images in the `Sample imagery` heading (duh), processed or otherwise. I expect to fill this in near the end of August due to me not being home right now.

# List of satellites that you can receive with SatDump

There are 22+ satellites you can receive in this band, more specifically:

- 5x FengYun 3
- 3x NOAA JPSS

### Description

- **Fengyun** **3D**, **3E**, **3F**, **3G**, and as of recently **3H** all transmit their mission data in the X-band, most notably their **AHRPT** direct broadcast
- These satellites also dump their mission data in a transmission called **DPT** (Delayed Picture Transmission)
- 3D, 3E, 3F all transmit full dumps to Kiruna, partial dumps to China (to get a lower delay for the South China Sea and Oceania). China also acts like a backup if Kiruna is undergoing maintenance.
- 3G only dumps to China due to its orbit
- 3H is still commissioning, is very simmilar to 3F
- The instruments vary between the satellites, notably:
    - FengYun 3E has a XEUVI for sun imaging
    - FengYun 3G is in an Inclined Equatorial orbit, carries RM (Rainfall measurement) instrumentation as its payload unlike the rest of the Fengyun 3 series. It is VERY fast and flies very low, making it receivable with a smaller dish than the rest albeit with significantly more difficult tracking. It also has an unusually small symbol rate at just 6 Msym/s.

### Description

- Being the current-gen constellation from NOAA+NASA, all JPSS (Joint Polar Satellite System) satellites transmit in the X-band -> **Suomi NPP**, **NOAA 20**, and **NOAA 21**
- NOAA 20 has suffered many issues, notably a failed detector in the VIIRS (imaging) instrument causing scan lines to appear in certain composites
- The Suomi NPP satellite also has occasional issues with its internal clock, causing imagery to process with erroneous dates (or lack thereof)
- All satellites have a null in their antennas' radiation pattern:
    - Suomi NPP has a strong null when it's west from your position at certain elevations
    - NOAA 20 has a strong null when it's east from your position at certain elevations
    - NOAA 21 doesn't have significant nulls and features much better FEC than the rest of the JPSS constellation

## Meteor-M

![As described below](../../assets/images/X-band-transmissions/meteor-kmss.jpg)
*Meteor-M N°2-4 KMSS DB crop from the first MSU-100, received on 19/3/2025 at 10:51 UTC by Konrad Unger. Processed with SatDump using the `Natural color` composite. 60% quality lossy JPEG compression and median blur applied, click [here](https://sat-archive.metislair.com/X-band/Meteor-M/KMSS/Meteor-M2-4/2025-03-19_10-51_meteor-kmss-db_UngerKonrad/kmss_msu100_Natural_color.png) for the full resolution image*



### Description

- **Meteor-M N°2-3** and **Meteor-M N°2-4** both transmit in the X band, dump to Russian ground stations using a NON-beamed transmission (the antenna is an open waveguide)
- Transmissions are separated into "Narrow" ones that have a ~15 MHz bandwidth and "Wide" ones which have a ~61 MHz bandwidth
- Meteor M2-3 has a **failed <u>wide</u> X-band transmitter**, making it only do <u>narrow transmissions</u>. This means it ONLY transmits MTVZA dumps and IKFS dumps (?)
- Meteor M2-4 transmits KMSS DB in and around Russia as well as over most of Europe, possibly the Caribbean and Brazil as well (unconfirmed)
- These satellites transmit a diverse amount of transmissions, as is seen in the tables below.

### Signal Tables

### Description

- **Aqua** and **Aura** are the only satellites from the NASA EOS (Earth Observation Satellites) constellation that still transmit DB, **Terra** still transmits dumps but the DB signal has been disabled in 09/2024 due to a power supply issue.
- All satellites from this constellation have a null in their antenna's radiation pattern above a ~60° elevation
- Aqua has a really poor type of FEC (Reed-solomon but no viterbi) which makes it require a quite high SNR for a decode.
- Aura only transmits the OMI instrument which is very low rate
- The dumps from these satellites are not implemented into SatDump (Encrypted?)

## Elektro-L

![As said below. Image includes a moon in the corner for vanity](../../assets/images/X-band-transmissions/elektro-rdas.jpg)
*Elektro-L2 Natural color composite received on 11/4/2025 at 12:29 UTC by lego11. 60% quality lossy JPEG compression applied, image resized to 25%. Aligned using the [Digitelektro's RDAS aligner](https://github.com/Digitelektro/rdas_layer_aligner).

### Description

- **Elektro-L N°2**, **N°3**, and **N°4** all transmit a <u>beamed</u> **RDAS** signal containing all raw channels every 15 minutes (L2 every 30 minutes due to power issues)
- Elektro-L2 suffered from a severe power amplifier failure making xRIT in the L-band unusable, weakening all transmissions for a while. <u> The satellite has seemingly recovered the transmission strength.</u>
- L2 and L3 both beam the transmission to Moscow, L4 beams it to Vladivostok. The beam is not very tight, L2 is receivable from Europe mostly fine.
- When not actively transmitting an image, a very strong carrier is present (transmitted up until about a minute before the next transmission)


### Signal table

<u>RDAS</u>

| Satellite  | Frequency | Symbol rate  | Polarization | FEC | Relative strength | Beamed | Location    |

## Arktika-M


![As described below](../../assets/images/X-band-transmissions/arktika-rdas.jpg)
*Arktika-M2 Natural color composite received on 2026-02-01 at 13:15 UTC by yours truly. 60% quality lossy JPEG compression applied, image resized to 25%.

### Description
- **Arktika-M N°1** and **Arktika-M N°2** both transmit beamed **RDAS** during their apogee to Moscow and Vladivostok (depending on which apogee the satellite is currently in - one is above the atlantic, the other is above the Bering Strait)
- The broadcast itself is identical to that of Elektro-L satellites, because Arktikas are the same bus; just shot into a molnyia orbit. However, it is at a different frequency - see the table below.
- Arktika-M1 has a much weaker broadcast when compared to Arktika M2

<u>RDAS</u>

| Satellite  | Frequency | Symbol rate  | Polarization | FEC | Relative strength                     | Beamed | Location            |

### Description

- **GEO-KOMPSAT2A** downlinks all of its 16 raw channels using an **UHRIT** transmission in real time
- This transmission is not beamed, should be receivable throughout the satellite's footprint
- The satellite also has an auxiliary raw sensor downlink that hasn't been received or decoded yet

### Description

- Metop-SG A1 carries a 500 m/px primary imager along with a fairly interesting 3MI instrument which images at 3 different polarizations for scientific purposes. It also carries some other instruments which haven't been looked into in detail yet.
- These are the latest and  ~~meant to be~~ greatest of what ESA has to offer, but are generally looked down upon primarily because of major issues with sensor striping, which is most visible on infrared channels. Consequently, most don't bother receiving these because of the huge data rate for relatively poor instrumantation; along with better choices existing.
- The FEC on these is exceptional, with clean data as low as 1.5 dB even given that it's QPSK.

### Description

- Both MetOp-B and MetOp-C dump their whole orbit to Svalbard on every pass, this dump includes all instruments just like in the [L-band] AHRPT transmission - in essence the transmission is just faster AHRPT
- Future satellites will be a part of the MetOp-SG constellation which will also transmit in the X-band, albeit at a significantly higher symbol rate

# Epilogue

I hope you found this page helpful in describing what you can receive in the X-band. If you are interested in knowing how to receive these signals, I recommend you check [lego11's X-band primer](https://www.a-centauri.com/articoli/an-x-band-primer) out. Please note that it's not a tutorial for beginners, given how difficult this band is to receive!
